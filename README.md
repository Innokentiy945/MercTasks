Task for MerckProject:

1. Write a program in Python that counts backwards from 100 to 1 and prints: “Agile” if the number is divisible by 5, “Software” if the number is divisible by 3, “Testing” if the number is divisible by both, or prints just the number if none of those cases are true. 

2. Use your preferred test automation tool to automate test case: Go to your favorite e-shop (better be site in English, but it’s still up to you), navigate to some category and add two most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category. Provide code from implementation.
